# 📦 Wallnance Tycoon – Changelog

## [v1.7.2] - 2025-10-06

### 🛠️ Last-minute UI Fixes (Tab Bar & Market)

- Tab bar reverted to a standard, in-flow bottom bar (no floating rounded container).
  - Uses SafeAreaView for bottom safe-area on mobile.
  - Removed absolute positioning and extra inset padding on mobile.
  - Desktop layout centered with max-width and full-width fallbacks so there is no left gap.
  - Tab items now flex evenly (flex: 1) so icons/labels distribute across the bar on desktop.
  - Removed unsupported "gap" usage and replaced with padding/margin for consistent spacing.

- Market / Coin list layout fixes:
  - Converted fixed column widths to responsive flex columns (name: flex 3, others: flex 1).
  - coinCardWide now uses justifyContent: 'space-between' so columns spread evenly.
  - Removed left‑anchored fixed-width behavior — coins and tokens center/distribute correctly on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

- Misc:
  - Tab icon container spacing and min sizes adjusted for desktop/tablet/mobile consistency.
  - Minor shadow and border tweaks to ensure a clean, full-width appearance on all platforms.

Notes:
- Reload the app after applying changes. If SafeAreaView is used and you don't have react-native-safe-area-context installed, run:
  - yarn add react-native-safe-area-context
  - or npm i react-native-safe-area-context

If anything still looks off on a specific desktop width or device, send the window width or a screenshot and I will refine.
